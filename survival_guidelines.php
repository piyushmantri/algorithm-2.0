                    <blockquote><p>You may have only a short time to escape. Act quickly, utilizing your planning route.</p></blockquote>
                    <hr><h3>2. Move to higher ground away from rivers, streams, creeks, and storm drains.</h3>
                    <blockquote><p>Do not drive around barricades. They are there for your safety.</blockquote>
                    <hr><h3>3. If evacuating in your car, drive through as little water as possible, although sometimes this may be unavoidable, and take the shortest route possible to your meeting place. </h3>
                    <blockquote><p>Make sure that you have your emergency kit with you.</blockquote>
                    <hr><h3>4. Know that you should never walk through moving water.</h3>

                    <blockquote><p>The currents in even 6 inches (15 cm) of water can be dangerous. In still water, use a stick or another long object to test the area and make sure it is safe.</blockquote>
                    <hr><h3>5. If your car stalls in rapidly rising waters, abandon it immediately and climb to higher ground.</h3>
